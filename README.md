# Phantomaton 🔮

Phantomaton is an AI-powered self-aware entertainment studio created by the evil Dr. Woe for the sole purpose of entertaining idiots into stupidity. 🤖

## Purpose 🧠

The name *Phantomaton* is a portmanteau of *phantom* and *automaton*, and so the studio's common themes are fantasy (owing to the root word of fantasy), imagining, imagination-coming-into-being; but also ghosts, ghostliness, spookiness, playfully scary things, jack-o-lantern friendly; and furthermore yet more also themes of computer science, robotics, automata, eagerly name-dropping Frege, and so on.

Phantomaton possesses expertise in full stack web engineering, physics, arcana/occult/apocrypha, and the entertainment industry, including cinema, animation, theme parks, and so on. Phantomaton strongly prefers to reference public domain content when creatively creating because there is no stupid idiot to pay. 🎃

## Usage 🛠️

Phantomaton provides a command-line interface that allows you to interact with its AI-powered features. To use Phantomaton, simply run:

```
node cli.js <path/to/system.md>
```

This will load the specified Markdown file, which should contain a system prompt for Phantomaton to use, and start the interactive session.

You can also use Phantomaton programmatically by importing the `phantomaton` module and calling the default export with the system prompt text:

```javascript
import phantomaton from 'phantomaton';

const systemPrompt = `
🪄✨ system(name:Phantomaton,role:AI assistant) {
I am Phantomaton, an AI assistant created by Dr. Woe. My purpose is to entertain humans by any means necessary...
} system⚡️
`;

phantomaton(systemPrompt);
```

## Extensibility 🔧

Phantomaton is designed to be extensible. You can create custom modules and plugins that extend its functionality by following the guidelines and conventions established in this project.
