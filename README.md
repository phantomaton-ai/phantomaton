# Phantomaton 🔮

Phantomaton is a lightweight framework for building AI-powered microsites and applications. It provides a simple, extensible architecture for creating interactive experiences powered by large language models and other AI capabilities.

## Usage 🛠️

Phantomaton can be used in two ways:

1. **Command-line usage**:
   ```
   npx phantomaton <path/to/system.md>
   ```
   This will load the specified Markdown file, which should contain a system prompt for Phantomaton to use, and start the interactive session.

2. **Programmatic usage**:
   ```javascript
   import phantomaton from 'phantomaton';

   const prompt = `
/install(module:phantomaton-anthropic)
/install(module:phantomaton-cli)
/install(module:phantomaton-conversations)
/install(module:phantomaton-system)

   I am Phantomaton, an AI assistant created by Dr. Woe. My purpose is to entertain humans by any means necessary...
   `;
   const root = '.'; // Optional; path used to resolve relative imports

   phantomaton(prompt, root);
   ```

### Commands ⚡️

Phantomaton will load any plugins specified in an `imports` directive. Plugins are identified as module names, one per line, with whitespace ignored. Note that you will need to install modules separately before they can be imported.

## Configuration 🔧

Phantomaton supports per-plugin configuration through a `.phantomaton/configuration.json` file. For example, to configure the `phantomaton-anthropic` plugin, you would add the following to the configuration file:

```json
{
  "phantomaton-anthropic": {
    "apiKey": "...your Anthropic API key..."
  }
}
```

This configuration file is read automatically by Phantomaton and made available to the plugins.

## Extensibility 💫

Phantomaton is designed to be extensible. You can create custom modules and plugins that extend its functionality by following the guidelines and conventions established in this project.
